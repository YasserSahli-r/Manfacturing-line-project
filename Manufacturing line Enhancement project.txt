Manufacturing line Enhancement project:-

The Used senser:-
Ultrasonic

The Controller:-
Arduino

The motor:-
Servo motor

How to use:-
The Ultrasonic will placed at the top of the Manufacturing line(on 3.5m in specific)
because the sensor will measure the distance to specify the size of the box

the distance between (200-300)cm represent small box then the motor will rotate to 135 degree

the distance between (100-299)cm represent medium box then the motor will rotate to 90 degree

the distance between (0-99)cm represent large box then the motor will rotate to 45 degree

Note""" it's possible to change distance of any box depends on the manufacture"""
